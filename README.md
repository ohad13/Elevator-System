# Elevators System

The Elevator-System app is a web application designed to simulate a building with multiple elevators, allowing users to select their desired floor and track the elevator's progress. The app is built using Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, and relies on HTML and CSS for the front-end design. The back-end functionality is implemented using JavaScript, with a focus on creating an efficient elevator scheduling algorithm to ensure smooth and timely transportation throughout the building. The app features a simple, user-friendly interface and can be customized for buildings with varying numbers of floors and elevators.

To compile and run the app:
```sh
npm run dev
```
